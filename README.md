# Riemann's Zeta function for Quaternions (Hypercomplex)

This is a C program that calculates the Riemann's Zeta function for Quaternions, a type of Hypercomplex numbers. The Riemann's Zeta function is a complex-valued function defined on the complex plane, and it has been extended to hypercomplex numbers such as Quaternions.

## Introduction

The Riemann's Zeta function, denoted as Î¶(s), is a fundamental mathematical function in number theory and complex analysis. It is defined for complex numbers s with real part > 1, and it can be extended to other domains including hypercomplex numbers.

In this program, we focus on computing the value of the Riemann's Zeta function for Quaternions, which are Hypercomplex numbers consisting of a real part, three imaginary parts (i, j, k), and a dual part. The Quaternion Zeta function is an interesting extension of the classical Zeta function to Quaternions.

## About the Code

The code is implemented in the C programming language. It provides a function `zeta` that takes a Quaternion as input and calculates the value of the Riemann's Zeta function for the given Quaternion. The program employs an iterative approach to compute the sum of terms in the series expansion of the function.

The `zeta` function takes a Quaternion `s` and the number of terms to sum `n`. It iterates from 1 to `n` to perform the summation. Within each iteration, it computes the necessary inverse squares and inverse quads for each term. It then updates the `term` variable by subtracting and adding the corresponding terms based on the formulas of the Riemann's Zeta function for Quaternions.

The resulting Quaternion value is accumulated into the `result` Quaternion. The iteration continues until the magnitude of the `term` falls below a specified epsilon value (`eps`).

## Usage

To use the program, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code file to your local machine.

2. Compile the C program using a C compiler such as gcc.

   ```shell
   $ gcc zeta_quaternion.c -o zeta_quaternion
   ```

3. Run the compiled executable.

   ```shell
   $ ./zeta_quaternion
   ```

4. Enter the real, imaginary, and dual parts of the Quaternion when prompted.

5. Enter the desired number of terms to sum.

6. The program will calculate and display the value of the Zeta function for the provided Quaternion.

## Example

Here's an example usage of the program:

```shell
$ ./zeta_quaternion
Enter the real part of the Quaternion: 1.5
Enter the imaginary part of the Quaternion: 2.0
Enter the dual part of the Quaternion: -0.5
Enter the number of terms to sum: 55
Zeta function value: 0.9159655942 + 1.2212829364i + 0.6106414682j
```

In this example, the program calculates the value of the Riemann's Zeta function for the Quaternion with a real part of 1.5, an imaginary part of 2.0, and a dual part of -0.5. It performs the calculation using 55 terms in the summation.
